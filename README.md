### [](https://github.com/salman0ansari/whatsapp-api-nodejs#whyuse)🧐 Why use this?
- 🌠 Fast : This project uses Baileys which does not require Selenium or any other browser to be interface with WhatsApp Web, it does so directly using a WebSocket. Not running Selenium or Chromimum saves you like half a gig of ram :/
